# Creamy Fire-Roasted Red Pepper Chicken with Jalapeño and Hot Honey

## Ingredients
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup fire roasted red peppers, chopped
- 1 cup red enchilada sauce
- 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
- 1/4 cup diced jalapeño peppers
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons hot honey
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups mixed frozen vegetables
- 2 cups cooked basmati rice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish (optional)

## Instructions
1. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for about 5 minutes, until softened and translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.

2. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

3. In the same skillet, add the fire roasted red peppers, red enchilada sauce, diced jalapeño peppers, and mixed frozen vegetables. Stir well to combine, and cook for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are heated through and tender.

4. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the ricotta cheese, heavy cream, and hot honey. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the sauce is creamy and well combined.

5. Return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet, spooning the sauce and vegetables over the top. Cover the skillet and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, to allow the flavors to meld together.

6. To serve, place a portion of cooked basmati rice on each plate. Top with a chicken breast and a generous helping of the creamy fire-roasted red pepper sauce and vegetables. If desired, garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro.

Enjoy this delicious and flavorful Creamy Fire-Roasted Red Pepper Chicken with Jalapeño and Hot Honey for a satisfying and unique meal!
